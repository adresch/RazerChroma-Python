# RazerChroma-Python
Simple python script to interact with Razer Chroma SDK
This script currently only allow you to play .chroma animations on all the Razer Chroma supported devices

Code is still garbage for now ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Inspired By [Chroma-SDK/python-SDK](https://github.com/chroma-sdk/chroma-python"Chroma-SDK/python-SDK Github")

#Generate Chroma Animation
To generate .chroma files containing animations for CHroma devices, take a look at [Razer Chroma editor](https://github.com/razerofficial/CChromaEditor"Razer Chroma editor Github")
